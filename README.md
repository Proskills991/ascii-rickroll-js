## How to Use

You can send the link to someone, as is ([youjustgot.com](https://youjustgot.com)) or add a name at the end like [youjustgot.com/?from=juxtopposed](https://youjustgot.com/?from=juxtopposed). 

The preview image will generate either a default one (no name) or one with the name so it's more impactful, like this:

Thanks to [this project](https://github.com/johnsoupir/ASCII_Rickroll) for the frames.

Happy rickrollin'.
